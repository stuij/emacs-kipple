[Added support for replace, toggling file "visibility".
Pekka.Pessi@nokia.com**20060818162247
 
 In order to support "replace", the changeset format had to be updated first. 
 For each non-hunk change, there are two symbols, e.g., -replace and replace. 
 The replace is visible, -replace is not. These symbols can now be toggled.
 
 Also suppporting file-level "visibility". addfile, newfile, rmfile and
 binary are toggled at file level, "visible" files are shown with *.
 
 Added functions (darcsum-toggle-item) to toggle item (from visible to
 invisible, and vice versa), (darcsum-item-visible-p) to test if item is
 visible, (darcsum-visible-item) to turn item to visible and
 (darcsum-invisible-item) to turn item to invisible.
 
 Everything that is not negative number and/or special invisible symbol are
 considered visible.
 
 Added function darcsum-change-< which is used to compare changes when adding
 and merging changesets. For this reason, addfile, newfile, rmfile and binary
 are sorted first.

[Updates to darcsum-whatsnew.
Pekka.Pessi@nokia.com**20060607170041
   
 Added darcsum-whatsnew-at-toplevel and gave it default value of t.
 If darcsum-whatsnew-at-toplevel is nil, use cwd as default value.
 
 Allow running darcsum-whatsnew also in subdirectory of repo, too. I have lot
 of subdirs and I don't want to clutter my view with them.
 
 When calling darsum-whatsnew interactively, do look-for-adds if
 darcsum-look-for-adds or prefix-arg is given. It looks like call to
 (interactive) was broken and --look-for-adds was always used. 
 --look-for-adds is awfully slow becase darcs likes to read all the
 non-boring files in the repo to the memory.

[Trying to fix darcs seeking problems.
Pekka.Pessi@nokia.com**20060530105600
 
 Sometimes darcs has read extra input from terminal and it tries to return
 the already read characters back to input stream by seeking backwards in
 stream. However, this is not allowed by runtime library and darcs dies with
 runtime error. 
 
 I try to avoid this bug by just sending "y" or "n" to darcs process. 
 However, this kludge does not work if the input stream is handled in cooked
 mode (line-by-line, as opposed to raw character-by-character mode).
